Luigi PipeLine Flow:

Generated a Merged Data Set containing Institution, URL, Position and Location which was hosted on Dropbox
Fetched this data from Dropbox and ran it against out Fintech/Non-Fintech Mechanism to generate new features
Uploaded the Final Dataset to Dropbox
Established a live connection from Dropbox for this data to Tableau Server, so as to generate visual outcomes
Steps to Reproduce the Luigi Pipeline:

Import the necessary Packages, i.e Luigi for pipelining, in our case
Download the code "pipeline_final.py" from the GitHub link mentioned above
The global namespaces for folders have been set automatically according to the OS, so there is no need to change file paths
Run "pipeline_final.py"
This will generate the final output and post it on Dropbox so that Tableau Server can eastablish a live connection
